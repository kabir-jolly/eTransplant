eTransplant Repository

We aimed to create a smartphone application that manages outpatient care post kidney transplant. The app is capable of tracking health metrics, connecting you with your care team, and managing scheduled medications on the road to recovery. This project was done in conjunction with CS 342: Building for Digital Health, and Dr. Marc Melcher from Stanford Med.

Technologies Used: CareKit, HealthKit, ResearchKit, CardinalKit, Firebase/Firestore
